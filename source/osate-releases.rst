Notable changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  There is a new preference setting to ignore an installed annex
   plugin.
-  Another new preference setting allows ignoring errors that are caused
   by a missing property set, e.g., when a model uses properties from a
   property set that is included in a plugin, but that plugin is not
   installed.
-  This is the last release that will work with Java 8. Starting with
   the next release OSATE will require Java 11.

.. _known-issues-1:

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  MacOS users must run the command
   ``sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine osate2.app/`` to be able to run
   OSATE.
-  Installing the OSATE plugins into “Eclipse for RCP and RAP
   Developers” may prevent Eclipse from starting. See `issue
   2061 <https://github.com/osate/osate2/issues/2061>`__.
-  Resolute and AGREE are no longer integrated. The versions included in
   OSATE 2.3.7 can be installed into OSATE 2.9.1 from
   http://osate-build.sei.cmu.edu/download/osate/stable/2.3.7/updates.
-  There is a minor bug (#2569) in OSATE 2.9.1 that prevents setting the
   AADL perspective as the default perspective in a new workspace. The
   bug also prevents the application icon from being shown and puts an
   entry “Product osate2 could not be found” into the error log at each
   start.This can be fixed manually by adding the following line to the
   osate.ini file.

.. _notable-changes-5:

Notable changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  We have changed instantiation of data and subprogram access
   connections, they no longer end at thread boundaries. As a result
   more flows can be instantiated. See issues #1941, #2009, #2032,
   #2059, and #2161 for details.
-  This version of OSATE is based on Eclipse 2019-12, so the context
   menu in the outline view does no longer disappear.
-  The first start after installation is significantly faster (seconds
   instead of minutes).
-  The Ocarina Connector plugin is now a separate component that can be
   installed via ``Help`` -> ``Install Additional OSATE Components``.
-  OSATE plugins and feature now use semantic versions. Developers of
   additional components can (and should!) make use of them to assure
   that their components are installed in a compatible OSATE version.

.. _known-issues-5:

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  MacOS users must run the command
   ``sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine osate2.app/`` to be able to run
   OSATE.

-  Installing the OSATE plugins into “Eclipse for RCP and RAP
   Developers” prevents Eclipse from starting. See `issue
   2061 <https://github.com/osate/osate2/issues/2061>`__.

-  Resolute and AGREE are no longer integrated. The versions included in
   OSATE 2.3.7 can be installed into OSATE 2.7.0 from
   http://osate-build.sei.cmu.edu/download/osate/stable/2.3.7/updates.
   Once newer versions are provided by
   `loonwerks <http://loonwerks.com>`__ in an update site, we will make
   them available via the “Install Additional OSATE Components” dialog.

   **After installing Resolute you must perform a clean build of your
   workspace, otherwise Resolute verification methods will fail with a
   class cast exception.**

.. _notable-changes-14:

Notable changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The graphical editor now supports annotations on diagrams and can
   visualize flows and modes for instance models.
2. Added support for Python scripting to OSATE. This uses Eclipse EASE
   with Py4J. See, for example, `this
   presentation <https://www.eclipsecon.org/france2016/sites/default/files/slides/EASE-ily%20Python.pdf>`__
   for an introduction. Python can also be used to write ALISA
   verification methods (see help text).

-  OSATE core

   1.  Resolve property constants in record fields
       (`#835 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/835>`__)
   2.  Fixed bogus error when validating property consistency along
       connections during instantiation
       (`#819 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/819>`__)
   3.  An empty annex library or subclause no longer causes an exception
       (`#816 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/816>`__)
   4.  Fixed corner case in connection validation with inverse feature
       groups
       (`#815 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/815>`__)
   5.  OSATE now contains a plugin that supports diagram export
       (`#707 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/707>`__)
   6.  End to end flows can now be expanded to show the flow segments in
       the instance model editor
       (`#859 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/859>`__)
   7.  Use short names for system operation modes
       (`#743 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/743>`__)
   8.  System operation modes can now be expanded to show the
       participating modes in the instance model editor
       (`#867 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/867>`__)
   9.  Instantiation now limits the number of system operation modes to
       1000 (`#666 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/666>`__)
   10. Cleaned up labels in instance model editor

      (`#852 <https://github.com/osate/osate2-core/issues/852>`__)

-  Graphical Editor

   -  Diagrams

      -  The file format used by previous versions of the Graphical
         Editor has been deprecated. Support for opening such diagrams
         will be removed in a subsequent release. When opening a legacy
         diagram, the user will be prompted to convert the file. The new
         file format is more compact and contains more reliable linkages
         with the AADL model.
      -  It is recommended to convert all legacy diagrams to the new
         format by opening them.
      -  Diagrams no longer use UUIDs are part of file names. Legacy
         diagrams will be renamed as part of the conversion process.
      -  Added support for multiple diagrams representing the same model
         element.
      -  Added a “Configure Diagram…” option to the diagram’s context
         menu which is used for configuring which model elements are
         displayed in the diagram.
      -  Removed diagram-wide nesting level option. The nesting level of
         diagram elements can now be controlled individually.
      -  Added Show Contents, Hide Contents, and Show Type Contents to
         the diagram element context menu.
      -  Added an asterisk indicator after labels which indicates
         whether all of the contents for an element are shown.

   -  Refactoring

      -  Renaming elements from the diagram editor will refactor the
         AADL model.
      -  Renaming elements from the diagram editor will update related
         diagrams.
      -  References in legacy diagrams are not updated.
      -  Renaming a model elment using the “Rename Element” menu option
         updates linkages in diagrams.

   -  AADL Property Support

      -  Reworked AADL property support. Individual AADL properties can
         be enabled on a per-diagram basis using the “Configure
         Diagram…” context menu.
      -  AADL reference property values between descendants which are
         not shown are displayed as a binding between the closest
         ancestors which are included in the diagram.
      -  AADL reference property values for the same AADL property,
         source, and destination are grouped together into a single
         connection.
      -  Added tooltip for grouped AADL property reference values which
         contains details about the property values.
      -  Bindings along with other reference properties now support
         bendpoints.

   -  AADL Features

      -  Features may be docked to any side. Previously only the left
         and right were supported.
      -  Feature group types use the same symbol regardless of the type
         of diagram. Previously, feature group types used a rectangle on
         classifier diagrams.

         -  Feature groups can be resized.

   -  Formatting

      -  Labels of classifiers on package diagrams are now located at
         the top and centered.
      -  Added labels for classifiers in classifier diagrams.
      -  Elements are now colored differently to indicate that they are
         not owned by the container.
      -  Added toolbar commands for positioning shapes in a radial or
         grid pattern.

   -  Miscellaneous

      -  Changed behavior of unique identifier generation to include the
         containing classifier’s name. This is to avoid naming conflicts
         with classifiers that extend the classifier being edited.
      -  Relaxed validation in the flow implementation tool. It is
         intended that the validation will be improved in a future
         release. The tool should allow creation of all valid flow
         implementations but will also allow selection of invalid
         elements in some circumstances.
      -  Modified filtering when selecting model elements. Now matches
         any part of name.
      -  Fixed cases where setting a subcomponent classifier was not
         working properly.
      -  Added support for connections whose features are not included
         in the diagram. Such connections are formatted differently from
         normal connections.
      -  Added command to navigate to component type diagram for
         subcomponents.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. We have included the EMFTA tool for fault tree analysis (see Help
   text). The existing export to OpenFTA has been removed
2. OSATE now includes requirements specification language (ReqSpec) from
   our ALISA project (see Help text)
3. Implemented approved language errata:

   1. Abstract features are allowed as mode transition triggers
   2. Added property Reference_Time

      3. Abstract features can reference classifiers in addition to
         prototypes:

         prototypes fp: feature; dt: data; features – feature is the
         prototype actual f1: prototype fp; – abstract feature
         referencing a data classifier f2: feature SomeDataType; –
         abstract feature referencing a data prototype f3: feature dt;

4. Added textual representation of instance models. Convert AADL
   instance model file to text via action “Generate Textual Instance” in
   AADL Navigator context menu
5. Added BIRT for report generation. An example report for requirements
   traceability is included: Action “Requirements Tracing” in context
   menu in the AADL Navigatior view, active for AADL packages, instance
   models, system requirements and system goals. The report sources are
   in plugin org.osate.reqtrace
6. Unnecessary plugins were removed to reduce download size
7. Updated Agree to version 2.1.3
8. The underlying Eclipse version has been updated to Mars.2

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Using the update site, under Windows7 you may have a file protection
   issue for your installation. Eclipse update is just silently failing
   to update rather than reporting “permission denied.” Please check the
   date of the installed OSATE feature (Open Source AADL Tool
   Environment) under Help->About and then Installation Details. If it
   did not get updated to the most recent date, please change your
   permissions.
2. Using the update site, when you are in OSATE (Eclipse) and just
   checked an update site for updates, Eclipse caches that information.
   If someone tells you about a new release on the update site, please
   exit and reenter OSATE so it will actually find the new release.
