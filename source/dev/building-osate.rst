Building OSATE
==============

OSATE is built using maven with the tycho plugin. Maven can be run
inside Eclipse or from the command line.

To run the build inside Eclipse we provide a couple of launch
configurations in project osate.releng. The launch configurations can be
run from Eclipse’s ``Run Configurations...`` dialog. They are inserted
under the Maven Build category.

The available launch configurations are

-  **osate.build.local** - build OSATE for the local operating system,
   e.g., build the windows version on a windows machine.
-  **osate.build.local.tests** - same as osate.build.local but also run
   all available tests
-  **osate.build.full** - build for all platforms, run all tests

The build can be configured by modifying the launch configuration.

   Local Build Launch Configurations

Available profiles *local* and *full* determine if the build is for the
local operating system only or for all operating systems.

Used parameters are

-  **tycho.dirtyWorkingTree** - Issue a *warning* or an *error* if there
   are files that uncommitted source files in the build.
-  **pr.build** - *true* build a pull request (no product archive
   created), *false* build the product(s)
-  **tycho.localArtifacts** - *ignore* only use artifacts from the
   current build and specified repositories to resolve dependencies.
-  **sign** - *true* perform jar signing during the build, *false* don’t
   sign jars
-  **spotbugs** - *true* run spotbugs during the build, *false* don’t
   run spotbugs
-  **codecoverage** - *true* run jacoco to create a code coverage
   report, *false* don’t run jacoco

The created archive file (*.zip and/or*.tar.gz) are created in project
*org.osate.build.product* in subdirectory *target/products*.

Note that the very first build usually fails in project
org.osate.reqtrace, but subsequent build should succeed.
