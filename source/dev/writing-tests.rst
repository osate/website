Writing Tests
=============

We use a stylized way of writing tests based on the xtext testing
framework. The test class declaration must extend XtextTest and be
annotated as follows:

.. code:: java

   @RunWith(XtextRunner)
   @InjectWith(Aadl2InjectorProvider)
   class ModeTransitionsTest extends XtextTest {

It is important to use the ``Aadl2Injectorprovider`` and not the UI
injector provider as the UI injector requires the presence of files in
an Eclipse workspace.

Provided Helper Classes
-----------------------

Class TestHelper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class provides access to the parser, linker, validator, etc. and
can process AADL strings and AADL files. It must be injected into the
test class:

.. code:: java

   @Inject
   TestHelper<AadlPackage> testHelper

Class TestResourceSetHelper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class provides a singleton resource set that can be reused across
tests. The resource set is initialized on creation with all contributed
AADL property sets and packages. It is mainly there for use in
``TestHelper``. Note that each call to ``getResourceSet()`` returns the
same resource set but removes all resources loaded since the previous
call.

Class AssertHelper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class provides a couple of extension methods for working with the
``FluentIssueCollection`` and to test scoping.

Examples
--------

There are a couple of examples that show how tests can be written:

-  in ``org.osate.core.tests``

   -  `Issue277Test.xtend <https://github.com/osate/osate2/blob/develop/core/org.osate.core.tests/src/org/osate/core/tests/issues/Issue277Test.xtend>`__
      This shows how to parse a string that contains AADL text and work
      with the resulting AADL Package.
   -  `Issue361Test.xtend <https://github.com/osate/osate2/blob/develop/core/org.osate.core.tests/src/org/osate/core/tests/issues/Issue361Test.xtend>`__
      This test shows how to instantiate a component implementation and
      work with the resulting instance model. Note that the instance
      model must be created in the same resource set as the declarative
      AADL model.
   -  `Issue1092Test.xtend <https://github.com/osate/osate2/blob/develop/core/org.osate.core.tests/src/org/osate/core/tests/issues/Issue1092Test.xtend>`__
      This test shows how to analyze issues reported during
      instantiation, see method ``testUnmappedModes()``.
   -  `ModeTransitionsTest.xtend <https://github.com/osate/osate2/blob/develop/core/org.osate.core.tests/src/org/osate/core/tests/aadl2scopeprovider/ModeTransitionsTest.xtend>`__
      This test shows how to get a fluent issue collection from an AADL
      string and how to work with it.

Running tests
-------------

Tests can be run in the development environment using ``Run as...`` ->
``JUnit Plug-in Test``. Running a plain JUnit tests does not work
because the test envoronment needs the eclipse plugin mechanism to load
contributed AADL property sets and packages.

In the tycho build, test plugins must run with the UI enabled because
tests load plugins that depend on UI plugins even if they donâ€™t use the
UI during the test.
