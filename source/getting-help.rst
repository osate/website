Getting Help
============

Please use the `Google group for
OSATE <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osate>`__ to ask
questions about OSATE. This group is also a good place to discuss
existing OSATE features and request new ones.

To avoid spam, only group members may post to the group, and posts by
new members are moderated.

See `Google Groups Help <https://support.google.com/groups>`__ for more
information about Google groups, e.g., how to sign up, and how to post.

Note that this group may not be the best place to post general questions
about AADL or the AADL language.
