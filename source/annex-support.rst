Annexes Supported in OSATE
==========================

EMV2 Language Support
---------------------

OSATE strives to supports all of EMV2 as specified in the annex
standard. However, the syntax used to apply a property to an EMV2 annex
element in a subcomponent cannot be implemented in our LL(k) parser
because it requires infinite look-ahead to distinguish applies to paths
that contain an ‘@’ from those that do not.

We use the following modified rule (note the added ^)

::

   emv2_containment_path ::=
        [ ^ aadl2_core_path @ ] emv2_annex_specific_path

The EMV2 implementation in OSATE contains the following extensions that
are proposed as errata (see `here <https:github.com/saeaadl/emv2/>`__)

-  Repair events require a ``when`` keyword
   (`#3 <https://github.com/saeaadl/emv2/issues/3>`__)
-  Allow single trigger as argument for operators ``ormore``,
   ``orless``, … (`#4 <https://github.com/saeaadl/emv2/issues/4>`__)
-  Support for operators ``all`` and ``all (...) but``
   (`#7 <https://github.com/saeaadl/emv2/issues/7>`__)
-  Allow out propagation of a subcomponent in out propagation condition
   (`#11 <https://github.com/saeaadl/emv2/issues/11>`__)
-  Allow references to out propagations of deeply nested subcomponents
   (`#26 <https://github.com/saeaadl/emv2/issues/26>`__)
